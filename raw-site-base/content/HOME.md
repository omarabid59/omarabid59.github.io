Hi, my name is Omar Abid and I am a **technology enthusiast **with a strong interest in computer **vision**, **machine learning**, and **electronics. **I am a highly motivated individual and I believe that through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collaboration</span>, we as a human species can bring new **innovations** to make the world a better place. How can we use technology to improve **patient outcomes**? To provide better medical diagnostics? To understand which patients are at risk of complications in the near future? How can we use technology to better understand **financial markets?** To leverage the **blockchain** technology? Technology excites me, but questions drive me.
