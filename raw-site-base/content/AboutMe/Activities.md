In this page I will highlight some of the activities I have been involved in to give you a better sense of the breadth of my interests.

# WORKSHOPS AND ACTIVITIES

[NextAI 2018](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai) is a Toronto based accelerator for early or idea stage AI-enabled startups. Made it to the finalist round among thousands of applications around the globe. Unfortunately, we were not shortlisted for proceeding into the next round. However, the connections and resources gained from the diverse set of individuals coming from a variety of different fields is indispensable.

[Archangel Summit](http://www.archangelsummit.com/) 2017\. This summit is the annual gathering of mission-driven entrepreneurs, leaders, and professionals who want to do well by doing good. As a volunteer helping ticket holders find their way through the venue, I had the opportunity to connect with highly motivated individuals.

# STARTUPS

I have also been part of the following startups. _**Delivery From Mars**_. An on campus food deliver application that uses a peer-to-peer network to connect individuals wanting food and grabbing food. Includes a rewards program to incentivize users to recurrently use the application. _**Fix My Tech Now**__. Provide software and hardware repairs for laptops, desktops, Xbox, Xbox 360 and PS3._ _**Bitcoin Arbitrage.**_ Buy and sell bitcoins at a high profit margin. For efficiency and to reduce mundane tasks inherent in such a system, we created a software (available on [GitHub](https://github.com/omarabid59/Bitcoin_LBTC_Trading)) to stream line this process.
